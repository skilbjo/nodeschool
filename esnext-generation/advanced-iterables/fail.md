# Almost there!

Check the errors above to see where you went wrong.

# Hints

 * Start by utilising your solution from _Introduction To Iterators_, and modify
   it to never return `done: true`.
 * Then, move on to adding the `isEven` parameter for odd/even iterables.
 * Finally, once you can correctly iterate numbers, attempt to swap between odd
   and even based on the value passed to `.next()`

# More Help
