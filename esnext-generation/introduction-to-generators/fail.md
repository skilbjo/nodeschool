# Almost there!

Check the errors above to see where you went wrong.

# Hint

Use the example provided in the lesson as a starting point, then modify it to
return the even/odd numbers the same as we did in _Advanced Iterables_.

Make sure you have node.js >= 0.11.4 (or any version of iojs) for your generator
to work (remember: it's a relatively new es6 feature).
